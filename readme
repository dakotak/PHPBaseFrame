My Idea of MVC
================
An mvc application should have only one entry point. I think this is safe to say even if the application
offers and API, in this case and API controller should be used. I like the idea of maybe, MAYBE just allowing
controller to load other controllers, but at the same time I think that this could get very messy.

(M)odels
---------------
Modeles are classes or objects the access data, this does not need to be data from a database, this could be
disk or shell commands, anything the gets data. Idealy a model will model, (Imagin that) the data you are 
trying to get. I belive that a strict relationship between models and controllers is lame. I thihnk that any
controller should be able to use any avalible modle givin it can satisfy the models requirements.

(V)iews
---------------
A view is a file, no a class or object that is able to access variables from the controller to render a view
to send to the user. Once again I dont think that views should be tied directly to a controller but becasue of
the nature of a controller and a view, most of the time they will be.

(C)ontrollers
---------------
A controller is a class or object with the job of requesting data from models and giving it to the view, most
of the time controllers shoudl be pretty light, since most of the work shoudl be done in the views and modles.
